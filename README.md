METHODS OF ALGORITHMIC COMPOSITIONS<br>
Strategies for the sonification of cellular automata<br>
cellular automata software in Processing JAVA for MIDI output for synthesizer

This rep consists of all research examples of the generation of musical pattern as MIDI information. The application is programmed in Processing JAVA and is designed to give an experimental environment to play with the idea of 2D cellular automata to generate in a live situation musical pattern. The work is linked to a thesis written at the mathematical institute at the university of Dresden.

In the first part of this work, a brief definition of the term generative art and algorithm is given and discusses how art and algorithms are connected. In the next chapter, a few methods are generally described and further, the main algorithmic model, the cellular automata and its mathematical and theoretical concept, will be explained. Following with the next part, the cellular automata and its sonification, where generated data from a cellular automata is translated within a musical mapping into a composition, are taken into consideration. Historically, there were pioneers like Xenakis, Millen, Beyls or Miranda who used different ways to interpret the data from the cellular automata in order to create their own score. The different models are briefly presented which lead to the main part of this work where an example of a sonification concept will be introduced. The sonification strategy is realized with Processing, a JAVA based programming language. The goal is to create a possibility to generate spatial and temporal musical structures from cellular automata, translated into MIDI information for the monophonic sound control of different synthesizers.
